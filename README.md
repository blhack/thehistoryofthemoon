I am really annoyed at the idea that students are not allowed to use wikipedia because "anybody can edit it".

Anybody can edit EVERYTHING on the internet.

I made this website so that students could have soemthing to show their teachers.

Hopefully teachers implement a more sane policy of "teach children how to use this incredible resources (wikipedia) instead of poisoning them against it".

Pull requests welcome.
